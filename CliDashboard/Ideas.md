# Ideas

- 🧠 Script tags or categories (e.g., [utility], [reporting], [dev])
- 🗂️ Folder grouping inside scripts/ with auto menu grouping
- 📜 Show script preview before running
- ⏱️ Track last used/run time in your YAML for analytics
- 🧪 Test mode to dry-run scripts or print their paths/commands
- 🧩 Plugin system so you can inject additional dashboards (e.g., Git info)
